# How we got here: Analysts’ stories of Rising to the Challenge

_Health and Care Analytics Conference 2025_

## My Story

### Your current role

- Senior data scientist at [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/) building open-source Reproducible Analytical Pipelines and providing public health analysts with the tools, skills, and confidence to develop their own reproducible analyses

### Your story so far – how did you get here 

- I found all my jobs through social media and meetups
- Involvment in communities [Royal Statistical Soceity](https://rss.org.uk/), [NHS Open Analytics](https://nhsrcommunity.com/), [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org/), local meetups
- Being helpful
  
### What has been your career path

- PhD in Statistics & Operational Research
- Data Science consultant in a number of small start-ups
- Providing training and support to the NHS as an external
- Joined the Strategy Unit 2 years ago

### Challenges along the way

- I've never worked in the NHS "on the ground" so I've not experienced those challenges although I sympathise with them.
- Focusing on what is within my circle of influence. This morning Steven talked about analysts needing to take initiative. I see lots of places where I can help, but the NHS is huge and it can be overwhelming. That can lead to burnout, which I have experienced. 
- I have to consciously focus my energy and skills where they have the most impact and protect my work-life balance.

### Something you’re proud of

- This year my team [won the Florence Nightingale Award](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/news/strategy-unit-demand-model-wins-prestigious-florence-nightingale-award). 

- The NHP model is the first nationally consistent, open-source model for forecasting future demand across hospital and community services. 

- The judges were particulary impressed by statistical robustness of the project - both in terms of the methodologies employed and the strong commitment to transparency.

- My team's motto is _Kindness; World domination_. I'm really proud to be part of a kind team. 💙

## Future analyst

### How do you think your role will change in the next 10 years? 

I honestly don't know. I've been a bit _AI grumpy_. I can't say "AI" without using airquotes. As a data scientist that's not a helpful. 
If I'm grumpy about AI when people seek my advice, they will seek advice from snake-oil sales folk who _will_ sell them stuff. Leading to AI being done _to them_.
I need to be part of the conversation and shift from AI grumpy to AI aware.

### What advice would you give to someone thinking about becoming an analyst or someone who’s early on in their analytical career?

Share your work. 

- It will [create an online portfolio](https://rhian.rbind.io/talks/2023-09-04-share-your-data-story/) - great for career development
    
- Communicating your work (in any format) will make you a better analyst

- It's vunerable putting your work out there, but feedback from a critical friend will develop your skills much more rapidly then working in a silo

### What is one thing that you would change to help analysts have more impact? 🪄

I'm a big believer in [reusability rather than reproducibility](https://rhian.rbind.io/talks/2024-11-22-reusability/) 
I'd love to see a National Code library of open-source public health code packages to help analysts across the system develop _together, earlier_.
Steal like an artist. Borrow with pride.
