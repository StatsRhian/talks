## Communication

* Set expectations about the relationship from the start
  * Clarity trumps accessibility
  * When is it the project finished - and who decides
  * Who is responsible for the tasks? E.g. Quality control of variables
  
* Understand the problem
  * Ask lots of questions!
  * What do you hope to answer by running that analysis
  * How will you know if youâ€™ve answered your question
  * Who is your client's audience?

## Statistics and Data

* Choosing a tool? - Keep it simple	
  * Easier to estimate time
  * Simplest technique that will do the job, not the fanciest technique
  * Choose a tool for solution for your client's audience understanding (learn the terminology and subculture)
  * Sometimes a graph is all you need

* Scoping a project? Ask to see the data!
  * It starts discussion
  * Gets NDAs & contracts moving quickly 
  * It will allow you to provide a more accurate scope
  * Break your scope into milestones 
  * Review data before the final time estimate

* Constantly assess the required knowledge/skills for your field
  * RSS CPD framework
  * Know **what** you know (and what you don't)
  * You don't need to know everything 
  * Keep up-to-date with identified required knowledge
