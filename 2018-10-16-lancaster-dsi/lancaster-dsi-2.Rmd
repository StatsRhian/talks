## Solution

* Split events up in to "chunks" of 2 seconds.
* Use Linear Discriminant Analysis to identify useful data features for classification.

## Applying this the full UK study

<!-- In the plot below, each point represents a 2 second window of an event.  --> 

```{r, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.width = 5}
data$Diary[data$Diary==2] <- 1
data$Diary <- factor(data$Diary)
levels(data$Diary) <- c("No", "Yes")

data  %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = lvy, y = lvz, colour = factor(Diary))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_colour_manual(values=c("skyblue1", "slateblue4"),
                        name = "Diary entry") +
    xlab("Log variation in Y axis") +
    ylab("Log variation in Z axis") 

```


Movement is generally characterised by **low feature values**, and roll-on application is characterised by **high feature values**. 


## Keep it simple!
<!-- With this insight we can identify likely non-application windows, and remove them from the dataset.

Simple approach: cluster the feature set using k-means. -->

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5}
k <- kmeans(data[,-6], 2)
if(sum(k$centers[1,]> k$centers[2,])<2)
  {k$cluster[k$cluster==1] <- "No"
   k$cluster[k$cluster==2] <- "Yes"
   }else{
   k$cluster[k$cluster==1] <-  "Yes"
   k$cluster[k$cluster==2] <-  "No"
   }

cbind(data, k$cluster)  %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = lvy, y = lvz, colour = factor(k$cluster))) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_colour_manual(values=c("skyblue1", "slateblue4"), name = "Classed as\ntrue event") +
    xlab("Log variation in Y axis") +
    ylab("Log variation in Z axis") 

```

## Estimating activity duration

<!-- Now that non-application windows have been identified, an estimate of of true application duration is made by counting the number of true application windows.-->

* We re-estimated event duration, excluding any 2 second chunks identified to be false applications.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("../derived_data/all_events_corrected.csv")
data <- mutate(data, My_class = estDur > 0)
```

<!-- Initially the loggers observed `r dim(data)[1]` events across the 30 users. 
 The new duration estimation suggests that `r dim(filter(data,My_class==1))[1]` of these are true application events.-->

<!--Histograms for the duration of product usage for the logger event duration and the estimated true duration time. They have been split into events that correspond with a diary event (purple) and those that don't (red). -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.3, fig.width = 5, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE  }
data %>%
  #filter(duration !=0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration)) +
   geom_histogram(data=subset(data, diary == 0),fill = "red", alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_histogram(data=subset(data, diary == 1),fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1) +
  xlab("Duration taken from logger event file (in seconds)") 


data %>%
 # filter(estDur != 0) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = estDur)) +
   geom_histogram(data=subset(data, diary == 0),fill = "red", alpha = 0.1) +
    geom_histogram(data=subset(data, diary == 1),fill = "blue", alpha = 0.1)+
  xlab("New estimated in-use application time  (in seconds)") + xlim(0, 125) 
```


* Many non-diary events now have estimated duration of 0 seconds
* There are no longer any excessively long events. 
* The average number of applications per day is now reasonable.

<!-- Ignoring any events with an estimated duration of 0 seconds, the average number of applications per day for subjects looks quite sensible.-->

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#data %>%
#  filter(estDur > 0)%>%
#  count(subjectid, Date) %>%
#  summarise(Avg_Num_Daily_Applications = mean(n)) %>%
#  round() %>%
  #ggplot(aes(x=Avg_Num_Daily_Applications)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.5)
 # print.data.frame()

```


## User behaviour
<!-- Once we throw away any events with a duration of 0 seconds, we can look at user behaviour across the study. Here, each box represents a subject. The bars summarise the total number of applications made over the duration of the study and as split by hour of application.-->

* Once false positive activites have been removed we can look at user behaviour.

```{r, echo = F, fig.width=10, fig.height = 2}
###Separate Date_Time into Date and Time
data <-
  data %>%
  mutate(Date = substr(eventtimes, 1, 10)) %>%
  mutate(Hour_Start = as.numeric(substr(eventtimes, 12,13))) %>%
  mutate(Day_of_Week = wday(dmy(Date), label = T))


data %>%
  filter(My_class == 1) %>%
  count(Hour_Start, Day_of_Week) %>%
  #ggplot(aes(x=factor(Hour_Start),y=n)) +
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour_Start,y=n)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=10)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Day_of_Week, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(4, 8, 12, 16,20,24)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2, 4,6,8,10)) +
  ylab("")+
  xlab("Time of application")

#data %>%
#  filter(My_class == 1) %>%
#  count(Hour_Start, subjectid) %>%
  #ggplot(aes(x=factor(Hour_Start),y=n)) +
#  ggplot(aes(x=Hour_Start,y=n)) +
#  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
#  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=10)) +
#  facet_wrap(~ subjectid) +
#  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(4, 8, 12, 16,20,24)) +
#  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2, 4,6,8,10)) +
#  ylab("")+
#  xlab("Hour of application")
```


* The bars summarise the total number of applications made over the duration of the study split by hour of application and day of week.

<!-- similar plot, but this time split across day of week.-->

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}

#data %>%
#  filter(My_class == 1) %>%
#  count(Day_of_Week, subjectid) %>%
#  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Day_of_Week), y = n)) +
#  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
#  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 8),axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 0, vjust = 0)) +
#  facet_wrap(~ subjectid)+
#  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)) +
#  xlab("Day of Week")+
#  ylab("")
```


## Conclusion

* We showed that logger data was reliable as a data collection method.
* A simple but useful analysis was developed to help identify true deodorant activities.
* We found that it was difficult to distinguish between rotational and up-and-down motion even under lab settings.
