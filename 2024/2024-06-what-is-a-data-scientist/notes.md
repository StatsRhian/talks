# What is a Data Scientist?
_The Insititute of Mathematics and it's Applications_

## About me

- Senior data scientist at [The Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/) building open-source Reproducible Analytical Pipelines and providing public health analysts with the tools, skills, and confidence to develop their own reproducible analyses

- R expert within the [NHS-R](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) communities

- Statistical Ambassador for the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/)

## How much maths do you use in your role?

A lot more than I used to! I'm having to dust off my maths brain again! I did a PhD in Statistics, but for the last 5 years I spent more time doing programming than statistics.

Now I'm helping [build a statistical model to predict demand in hospitals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXBxDOa6tfw) as part of the New Hospital Programme.

- Record level data for Inpatients, Outpatients and A&E (HES)
- Hundreds of parameters, set by each hospital (in an R Shiny application)
- Stochastic Monte-Carlo model to handle uncertainty
- Creates 256 possible futures
- Results visualised in a R-Shiny app
- (Working toward) open source 

## What is a typical day/week as a data scientist for you?

- Weekly team stand up
- Working in four-week sprints
- Helping other analysts internally (organising coffee & code)
- Lots of cross team chatting about projects
- Quiet development time (VSCode & GitHub)
- Pair programming
- Attending virtual seminars
- Chatting on Teams & Slack (better emojis üíÅ)
- Friday CPD catch up & review
