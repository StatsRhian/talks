# If we have *all* the data - statistical sampling is redundant!

* We never have *all* the data.
* Beware of hidden biases in messy data.

## Final Thoughts

--
ers little by itself.

--

There are a lot of small data problems that occur in big data, and they don’t disappear because you’ve got lots of the stuff. They get worse.

--

New developments such as Hadoop and Apache Spark allow storage and fast processing of big data.

--

With carefully built models, well thought-out statistical assumptions, awareness of bias and domain-specific knowledge, big data can be a very powerful tool.
