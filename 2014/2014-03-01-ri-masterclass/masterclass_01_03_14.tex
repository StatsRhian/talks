  \frametitle{Permutations}
In this class we are going to consider the theory of permutations, and use them to solve a problem posed in an episode of Futurama. 

%A permutation of a set $X$ is a rearrangement of its elements.

%FACT: There are 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 permutations that can be made of the little
%coloured squares on the faces of Rubik’s cube.

%FACT: Any scrambled Rubik’s cube can, in theory, be restored to its original
%configuration in 20 moves or less.

  \frametitle{What is a permutation?}
A permutation of a set X is a rearrangement of its elements. \\
\textcolor{white}{.}\\
Example\\
Let X =$ \left \{\mbox{Jack, Queen, King} \right\} $. Then there are six permutations: 


Jack Queen King, \qquad Queen King Jack, \qquad King Jack Queen, 

Queen Jack King, \qquad King Queen Jack, \qquad Jack King Queen.
  

%Order is important.

%\begin{frame}
%  \frametitle{More precisely...}
%  Definition


%Notation
%Let $X= \left\{1,2, \hdots, n\right\}$ and $\alpha: X \rightarrow X$ be a permutation. It is convienient to describe this function in the following way:


%\[ \alpha = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
%1 & 2 & \hdots & n  \\
%\alpha(1) & \alpha(2) & \hdots & \alpha(n)  \end{array} \right)   \] 

%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Another example}
%A permutation of a set X is a one-to-one correspondence from X to itself. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let the set be $X = \left \{1,2,3 \right\}$.
    \item Define $\alpha$ be a permutation that takes $\alpha(1) \rightarrow 2, \alpha(2) \rightarrow 3, \alpha(3) \rightarrow 1.$ 
      \item We can think of $\alpha$ as a function machine. 
  \end{itemize}


%So we write:

%\[ \alpha = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
%1 & 2 &3   \\
%2 & 3 &1  \end{array} \right).   \] 

%Again, let the set be $X = \left \{1,2,3 \right\}$.
%
%Let $\alpha$ be the permutation that takes $\alpha(1) \rightarrow 2, \alpha(2) \rightarrow 3, \alpha(3) \rightarrow 1.$ 

%$\alpha = $   \includegraphics[width = 2cm]{permutation.png}

  \frametitle{Permutation Diagrams}
  We can write this permutation down in a permutation diagram as shown. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width = 3cm]{permutation}
\end{figure}

$\alpha(1) \rightarrow 2,\qquad \alpha(2) \rightarrow 3,\qquad \alpha(3) \rightarrow 1.$ 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Lets try multiplying}
  
If we write $\alpha \circ \beta$, this means apply the permutation $\beta$ to our set, and then apply the permutation $\alpha$ to our set. 
We're using the convention working from right to left which might look a bit strange but you'll get used to it.% ($\alpha \circ \beta  = \alpha (\beta (X))$)

Example

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width = 3cm]{definition.png}

$\alpha \circ \beta = $

%\begin{equation*}
%\alpha \circ \beta \neq \beta \circ \alpha   
%\end{equation*}


%Note: These are not the same. Therefore products of permutations don't necessarily commute.

%\end{frame}

%A diagram that swaps just two elements is called a transposition

%Disjoint transpotitions commute.

%Every permutation can be written as the product of some sequence of transpotions. 

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cycle Notation}
%Mathematicians are lazy so writing out long diagrams is not hand. 
Cycle notation allows us to write down permutation diagrams in a more efficient way.
Lets think about this permutation $\alpha = $ \includegraphics[width = 2.5cm]{c1}
%\[  \alpha = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
%1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5  \\
%2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 1  \end{array} \right) .   \] 

We could write this in a cycle, 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height = 2.5cm]{cycleNotation.png}
\end{figure}

or in short hand $\alpha = (1 \; 2 \; 3 \; 4 \; 5)$.




  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Composition of cycles}
We can write down compositions of cycles without the $\circ$ symbol (again mathematicians are lazy!)

So
\begin{equation*}
   (1 \; 2 \; 3) \circ (4 \; 5) = (1 \; 2 \; 3)(4 \; 5)
\end{equation*}

Example

\begin{equation*}
  (2 \; 3 \; 5)(1 \; 5 \; 4) = (1 \; 2 \; 3 \; 5 \; 4)
\end{equation*}


\textit{Reminder: We work from right to left.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Disjoint cycles}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Two cycles are said to be \textit{disjoint} if they act on disjoint sets of symbols. 

\item In the examples on the previous slide the cycles (1 2 3) \& (4 5) are disjoint, while the cycles (1 5 4) \& (2 3 5) are not.

\item Note  that (1 2 3)(4 5) = (4 5)(1 2 3). These cycles commute. 

\item This makes sense if we look at a diagram.
  \end{itemize}


\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Disjoint cycles}
   Since the cycles (1 2 3) and (4 5) are disjoint, they act in a sense independently of one another so it doesn't matter which one you consider to be taking first.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width =5cm]{disjoint.png}
\end{figure} 
 It is very useful to be able to express a permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, because then its structure is immediately clear. 
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Disjoint cycles: Example}
We write the permutation $\alpha = $ \includegraphics[width=3cm]{c2}
%\[  \alpha = \left( \begin{array}{cccccc}
%1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6  \\
%2 & 5 & 6 & 3 & 1 & 4 \end{array} \right) ,   \] 

as a product of disjoint cycles. 

Start with any number, say 1. Notice that 
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:1}
  \alpha: 1 \mapsto 2, \quad 2 \mapsto 5,\quad 5 \mapsto 1. 
\end{equation*}

Thus (1 2 5) is one of the cycles of which $\alpha$ is composed.

Next take any of the remaining numbers, say 3. Then

\begin{equation*}
  \alpha: 3 \mapsto 6,\quad 6 \mapsto 4,\quad 4 \mapsto  3.
\end{equation*}

Hence $\alpha = (1 \; 2 \; 5)(3 \; 6 \; 4) = (3 \; 6 \; 4)(1 \; 2 \; 5).$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Transpositions}


  \begin{itemize}
  \item A transposition is simply a permutation that only switches 2 elements of the set, and everything else stays the same. 

\item One example of a transposition is (3 4).
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}
 
% So we can express every permutation as a product of disjoint cycles - useful.

%Something else which will be useful later is a 2-cycle of a transposition. 

%Every cycle can be expressed a product of transpositions.*Question* (Not  necessarily disjoint).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item   Consider just the 7-cycle $(1\;2\;3\;4\;5\;6\;7)$.
\item  Introduce two new bodies that have not had their minds swapped, say $x$ and $y$.
\item  To return all minds of back to the right bodies, apply the following sequence of transpositions:
\item $(x\;7)(y\;1)(y\;2)(y\;3)(y\;4)(y\;5)(y\;6)(y\;7)(x\;1)$.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What if the cycle is really long?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item   Consider the k-cycle $(1\;2\; \hdots \;k)$.
    \item Introduce two new bodies that have not had their minds swapped, say x and y.
      \item Apply the following transpositions:        \item $(x\;k)(y\;1)(y\;2)\hdots(y\;k-1)(y\;k)(x\;1)$.

  \frametitle{Why does it work ?   $(x\;k)(y\;1)(y\;2)\hdots(y\;k-1)(y\;k)(x\;1)$.}
 
  \begin{itemize}

\item First step is to apply $(y\;k)(x\;1)$.
\item $(y\;k)(x\;1)(1\;2\; \ldots\; k) = (1\;2\;\hdots\;k-1 \;y\;k\;x)$.
  \item	Then $(y\;k-1)$ puts the mind of $k-1$ back where it belongs.
\item	And then $(y\;k-2)$ puts the mind of $k-2$ back where it belongs.
\item	Continue this until $(y\;1)$ puts the mind of 1 back where it belongs.
\item	And finally, we swap $x$ and $k$.
\item	When we finish $x$ and $y$ are still muddled but they have never swapped with each other!

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fixing products of disjoint cycles}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What do we do when we have multiple cycles to start with?
  \item	Use x and y to fix each individual cycle.
  \end{itemize}

%\item	When doing this, x and y will sometimes be swapped.
%\item	If there is an even number of disjoint cycles, then we're done after we fix each individual cycle.
%\item	If there is an odd number of disjoint cycles, then after fixing each individual cycle, finish by swapping x and y.
