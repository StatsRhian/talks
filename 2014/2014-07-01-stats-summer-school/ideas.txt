Lecture 1

Maths detective! Finding clues to understand the hidden pattern. 

What is statistics? - NOT JUST DATA!
Uncertainty

Population and samples
Gambling. 
Tip from a friend (finance) or casino should we play?
Get a return. 
Assume we know the probabilities, therefore we can calcuate the average return. 
Ideas: You can have runs of bad luck (or good) - therefore variance matters. Even if the game is in your favour, you might not want to play. 
If you look at trendline/avereage return, you don't get the whole picture. 
Leads into what is we don't know the probilities underlying. Thats the equivalent of taking a sample from a population. 
It's hard to see what is happening underneath.

Lecture 2

Regression to mean, speed cameras and also rice/cancer

Get a positive results, what is the probability that that you have a disease?
Breast cancer screening and terrorists.

The Brief - Statistics, Probability and Real Life Problems

Statistics is not only a theoretical subject: it has a real impact on people's lives.  During the Summer School you will hear about:
    how probability and statistics help analyse winning strategies for games,
    how statistics is used - and misused - in the courtroom and,
    why a positive or negative result in a diagnostic test might not quite mean what you would expect.
Using a statistical computer package, you will explore some associated problems and data, then produce a poster and presentation describing your results.

Our rough plan RANDOMNESS

Ice breaker?
Intro, who we are, what we do?
What is a statistician?
What is statistics?
Sample/Italian Earthquake?

Just numbers?


Is that a big number? Examples
Telegraph 2005, Raising the age of retirement  for men 65-> 67. 1 in 5 who would formally have survived long enough to collect a pension would now die before recieving a penny. 
Yse that is big! But the really number is that 20% men die before 67, only 4% die within the 2 year gap of 65 - 67

1997 Labor gov said it would spend and extra £300m over five years to create a million new childcare places. Break it down. £300 per place, £60 per year, £1.15 per week.

The perils of ignoring variance

False positives
Causation / Correlation
Regression to the mean

Is this pattern random?

Things go up and down. Dog walker,sports illustrated
Death and serious injury fell by 35% on speed camera roads. Experiment. Each person is a road. Roll die twice and sum the throws - this is number of accidents. Any "black spots" (10, 11, 12) get given a speed camera. Roll again twice.
