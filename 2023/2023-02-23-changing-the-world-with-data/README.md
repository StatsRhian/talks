# 2023 Speakers for Schools Changing the world with data

A three hour activity developed by Clarissa and Rhian for 14 - 19 year olds.

## Abstract

Are you the type of person that likes creating order from chaos, using data, numbers and information, and don’t know what to do with that curiosity? Then read on, because this could be for you.

You might have heard of consultancy companies before, and you’ve probably noticed that that term can be a bit vague – and you’d be right! In our case, we’re a data science consultancy company – and that means that people come to us with problems involving data they’ve collected, and ask us to help them to come up with a solution. Sometimes we’ll build a solution for them, but sometimes they ask us to show them how to do it themselves, so that they don’t need us in the future – which we’re more than happy to do!

This activity aims to give you a taste of what it’s like to be a problem solver for a living. We’ll be showing you how to use some of the tools we use to make interactive websites and dashboards that people can use to see all that data that they’ve collected in a useful way. Then, we’ll become your clients! You’ll get the opportunity to design and build something yourself that can fix whatever problem we bring to you.
