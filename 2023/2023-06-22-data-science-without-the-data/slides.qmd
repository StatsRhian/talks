## The Client

::: columns
::: column
-   Database of patients with a rare disease
-   Consulted us to perform the data analysis for a study
    -   200 statistical results (count, %, mean, sd, median, IQR)
    -   Interrupted Time Series Analysis

::: notes
2000 patients from 6 countries 6 subtypes of the disease 3 drugs Introduce Marcus
:::

## Stratifications

-   Country
-   Subtypes of the disease
-   Mobility
-   Drug
-   Year
-   Age of patient

::: notes
6 subtypes of the disease 3 drugs 13 patients were on two drugs simultaneously, none were on all three
:::

## For example

-   What is the average age of patients when they are diagnosed (by country and subtype)?

-   What percentage of patients are taking Drug A (by country, subtype and year)?

# Simple, yes? {background-color="#5b868d"}

```{r}
data |>
  group_by(country, subtype) |>
  summarise(mean = age_at_diagnosis)
```

## The challenge ðŸ™ˆ

-   Write a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan without seeing *any* data
-   Start development with a small subset of the data
-   We can't see the data for Germany *ever*

## Time to chat ðŸ’¬

:::: columns
::: column
-   Have you experienced scenarios have led you to having no data?

-   What problems did you encounter?
:::

You might not work with medical data, but this can also manifest in other scenarios

## The power of statistical summaries

:::: columns
::: column{width="65%"}

-   For each dataset, calculate all the summaries we might need at a granular level
-   We can combine these summaries as we like
-   Calculate stratified results from the summaries
    - Mean:  $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=i}^{N} x_{i}$
    - Standard deviation: $\frac{1}{N - 1} \sqrt{\sum_{i=i}^{N} x^2_{i} -  (\sum_{i=i}^{N} x_{i} )^2}$

But this won't work for median / IQR.

## Develop an R package

:::: columns
::: {.column width="75%"}
-   Run it on the data we can see
-   Send it to Marcus
-   He sends us an `.RDS`
-   We can aggregate and plot as needed

```{r}
devtools::install_local("describeDisease.tar.gz")
library("describeDisease")
run_analysis("path/to/german.xlsx")
```

Why R? Collaborator was an R user
:::

## Where to develop?  

:::: columns
::: column
- Data security is important
- Client wanted controlled access and logs
- [Shared projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/211659737-Sharing-Projects-in-RStudio-Workbench-RStudio-Server-Pro)
- Multiple sessions
:::

::: column
![](images/workbench.png){fig-alt="The posit workbench logo"}
:::

::::

::: notes
-   CSVs automatically download
-   Pro - not your compute, client visibility, same environment
-   Downside requires internet (Eurostar, being patched - programming from memory)
:::

## Data exploration

:::: columns

::: column

-   What values are unique per patient?

-   Which stratifications are viable?

-   Quarto document for data exploration and validation
:::

::: column
![](images/quarto.jpeg){fig-alt="The posit workbench logo"}
:::

::::

::: notes
printing summary stats, graph, factor levels, data types 13 patients on 2 drugs simultaneously, none on all 3
- Pros - Easy for collaborator to share with you - Control to explore
- Cons - How to ensure you don't see something you shouldn't - Additional dependencies for the collaborator
:::

## Data validation packages ðŸ“¦

-   [{validate}](https://github.com/data-cleaning/validate)
-   [{assertr}](https://github.com/ropensci/assertr)
-   [{data.validator}](https://appsilon.github.io/data.validator/)
-   [{pointblank}](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/)

# What happened? {background-color="#5b868d"}

## Sure, we'll send you dummy data

## Oh no

It was an XLSX worksheet

## Sure, we'll send you the schema

## Oh no

## Oh no

:::: columns

::: column
-   It wasn't validated.
-   Patients with stop dates but no start dates
-   Patients with start & stop dates but with the drug name missing

Whose responsibility is it?

:::

::: column
![](images/ohno.jpg){fig-alt="Cartoon figure saying 'Oh no'"}
:::

::::

::: notes
-   You don't want to have arguments about the data quality
-   Clarify whose responsibility it is to validate the data in advance
-   What does validated data "look like"
:::

## Okay let's run the analysis

## Oh no

_Hi Rhian, I have run the code, unfortunately I get the error you can see below. Please let me know how to proceed. Thanks, Marcus_

_Unfortunately, I get the error below. The same error also appears when I only use the data that you already have, which is strange because I suppose that you have already tested this script on that data. I'll try fiddling around a bit to make sure it's not something on my side, but we can also have a chat and screenshare if that could help!_

![](images/results.png){fig-alt="Table of results, mostly blank (-,-)" width="618"}

![](images/graph.png){fig-alt="Facetted ggplot graph showing points and standard deviation"}

::: notes
-   The data was very sparse
-   Small sample size, many correlated stratifications, and censoring
-   Understood the data
-   Sees the potential
-   Better informed for the next round of studies
:::


## In hindsight

-   Push back earlier to evidence to data challenges
-   Set realistic expectations
-   Use a proper database
-   Lean heavily on `purrr::map2()` with `tidyr::nest()`
-   Different git workflow
-   Use {renv} from the start

::: notes
Recreate the database from a SQL dump

Because the people running the study didn't know the data - they wanted to ask for *everything* "just in case". I think this made things worse and taking the time to help them understand what is possible in the data and what they cared about would have avoided the millions of censored results issue.
