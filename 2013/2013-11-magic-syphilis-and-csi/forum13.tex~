Achievable resolution is dependant on the information content of the image. If an image has low information content  it is said to be sparse and can be perfectly reconstructed from a small number of measurements. 

\bf{Nearly all real world images exhibit this sparsity property when transformed using a wavelet basis.}

  \item A signal is known as being \textbf{K-sparse} if $\boldsymbol{x} \in R^N$ can be represented as a linear combination of $K$ basis vectors. 
   \item Interested in $K \ll N$.
     \item If a signal is \textbf{compressible} there exist $K$ large coefficients but the remaining $N-K$ coefficients are only required to be small and not necessarily zero.

 \begin{frame}{What is compressive sensing?}
Compressive sensing is a method of \textbf{reducing the amount of data collected} from a signal without compromising the ability to later \textbf{reconstruct the signal accurately.} This method will only work if the signal of interest is compressible.

\begin{frame}{Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)}
 A matrix $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ satisfies the (RIP) of order $K$ if there exists a $\delta_K  \in (0,1)$ such that 
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:40}
  (1 - \delta_k)\|\boldsymbol{x}\|^2_2 \leq\|\boldsymbol{\Phi} \boldsymbol{x}\|^2_2 \leq (1 + \delta_k)\|\boldsymbol{x}\|^2_2,
\end{equation*}

for all $\boldsymbol{x} \in \sum_K = \{\boldsymbol{x}:\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_0 \leq K\} $, \newline

where $\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_0$ is the zero pseudo-norm defined as

\begin{equation*}
\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_0 = \#(i|x_i \neq 0). 
\end{equation*}

If $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ satisfies the RIP with order $2K$, then $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ approximately preserves the distance between any pair of $K$-sparse vectors. Unfortunately the task of checking that a matrix satisfies the RIP is a NP-hard problem, but fortunately the RIP will hold true with high probability if $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ is selected as a random matrix and $M \geq cK\log \frac{N}{K}$, where $c$ is a small constant.
