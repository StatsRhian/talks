* Tables were common
* Graphs were seen as inferior

Fortunately, Florence ignored William Farr.
None but scientific men ever look in the Appendix of a Report.
And this is for the vulgar public.


* Are tables better?

* Show variations in weather and other phenomena over calendar cycles.
* Variation of the pie chart
* uses equi-angular sectors of differing radii
* rather than sectors with varying angle, but equal radii
* direction of the wind in 8 sectors
* births and deaths by hour of theday.

* Nightingale probably got the idea from William Farr, who in turn was acquainted with Guerry's work.

* Name (rose, polar area, wedges) - not coxcombe
* Describe it visually
* Worked with Dr William Farr (Medical Statistician)

Nightingale hoped her charts would liven up her publications; the queen, she thought, might look at the pictures, even if she did not read the words.

Compare to a pie chart:

1. Each slice is an equal sector
1. Each slice allows area comparison with other slices
1. Easier to compare radii than angles

If we had been interested in making a strictly informative graphic, the heart shape would have been an impractical, and frankly, poor choice to display this data. Comparing the size of asymmetric shapes is difficult, and it is unclear if the variable scales linearly with the diameter of the shape or non-linearly with the area of the shape.
But, we were more interested in creating a feeling.
